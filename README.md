# Game_Engine2D 

This Project is my try to develop a Game/GameEngine from Scratch.
I want to understand how all the parts of a Gameengine work together like
animation handling and A.I.

The Game (when finished) will be a simple ARPG.
If you want to build your own game with this code just go on and do it. Its 100% opensource.

I will add a small description for all the *.py files here later.
